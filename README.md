# em-core-isncsci-algorithm
JavaScript version of the ISNCSCI algorithm using Google Polymer as framework.

IMPORTANT!!!

The current component is in beta. The algorithm can calculate RHI's 83 test cases.
In the following weeks, I will perform more testing and complete the examples and code documentation.
Version 1 will be ready soon.
